This website was my first javascript based project. 

<ul>It is offering some cool functionality such as

<li>  Saving your favorite color palette in Local Storage of the browser. </li>
<li>  Locking your favorite color in the palette and rest will be generated radomly.</li>
<li>  To copy the particular color just click on the colorCode. The color code will be automatically copied to your clipboard.</li></ul>
